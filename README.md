# cv-site
This is my cv site which are uploaded to [palchukdenis.com](htttp://palchukdenis.com)
It's just a static site which are delivered by ansible + github actions

### p.s.
I know that ansible + github actions are quiet overengeneering (especially for static site). But I wanted to learn something new and I did that
